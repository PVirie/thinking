# Thinking model
An implementation of thinking model version XL (codename: knapsack).


## Core principles

### Axiom: mind aims to reduce discrepancy between itself and the world

#### Conjecture: mind aims the equilibrium where the properties are related by space-time.
#### Theorem I': goal approaching is convex under duality.

#### Conjecture: mind encourages exploration via boring and forgetting.


## Hierarchy model

### Axiom: mind aims the equilibrium where there is no discrepancy between levels in the hierarchy.
#### Theorem II': why hierarchy is good


## Knapsack

Using fix object-feature representation to implicit generalization.


## To do
* Clear weight on retrain
* Implement knapsack GPU
* Implement trainer
* Test hippocampus new functions (compute_entropy, get_next)
