## Duality 

### Axiom: mind aims to reduce discrepancy between itself and the world

#### Conjecture: mind aims the equilibrium where the properties are related by space-time.

### Axiom: mind aims the equilibrium where there is no discrepancy between levels in the hierarchy.

#### Theorem I: optimization in hierarchy
#### Theorem II: why hierarchy is good
