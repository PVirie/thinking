# Thinking model
An implementation of thinking model version XXIV (codename: duality).


## Duality 

### Axiom: mind aims to reduce discrepancy between itself and the world

#### Conjecture: mind aims the equilibrium where the properties are related by space-time.
#### Theorem I': goal approaching is convex under duality.

#### Conjecture: mind encourages exploration via boring and forgetting.


## Hierarchy model

### Axiom: mind aims the equilibrium where there is no discrepancy between levels in the hierarchy.
#### Theorem II': why hierarchy is good

## To do
* Bridging hippocampus module
* Embedding representation in each layer
* ~~Pattern enhancer~~
